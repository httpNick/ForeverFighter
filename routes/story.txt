<div class="page-header"><h1>Why</h1></div> 
<p class="tab para">A lot people out there battle this sickness every day and their families do as well. I can’t tell you how many sad stories I heard about what happens to families once their family members get diagnosed with cancer. It’s the hardest thing to deal with and it destroys many families. Above all, it destroys a lot of  really good people. See cancer doesn’t judge if you’re good or not. It’s like a bully, it doesn’t care. What you did in your past, who you are, how strong you are, or how much money you have in the bank doesn’t matter. It’s coming to get you and take everything from you. The only thing you have in this life to fight it with, besides advancements in medicine, is ATTITUDE. The right attitude is the only thing this cancer can’t take away from you. The right attitude creates a fighting spirit and a fighting spirit can’t be beaten. <br>
<p class="tab para">The story of FOREVER FIGHTER is about showing people that they’re not victims or survivors of cancer, but Forever Fighters of cancer. Even if it does come back you’re ready to take it on with everything you’ve got. It might take your life, but it will never take your spirit or your attitude. Without the right attitude and fighting spirit you have already lost the fight. </p>
