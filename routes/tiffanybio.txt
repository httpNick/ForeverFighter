I started acting as a way for me to express myself fully. The ability to envision a script and portray a character far different from myself gives me a creative ability like no other. I can be someone else and bring someone's idea full circle. Acting is an outlet for me that I fully enjoy and plan on doing for years to come. With forever fighter I plan on taking on my character Annie with full commitment. To really dig deep into who she is as a person. She's a strong character that I have many plans for. I'm thrilled for the opportunity to bring her and this amazing story to life.
