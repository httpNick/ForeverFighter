<p>I have done several productions in the local area. The first 
production that was produced was called Rollerella, which is about Cinderella on 
roller blades. This film was shot in two weeks in Richland WA. 
The second film we produced was a commercial for a local insurance 
company that was for a contest that they were doing and the commercial won first 
place in the nation. I have also worked for the hit Tv show America Got Talent and the show X Factor. I recently Graduated from Seatter Film Institute in 2011. </p>
