<p>Mary’s passion for acting began at a young age when she took on the role of a pompous general in the

   theater production “Stone Soup”. She was able to carry that passion into all facets of her life and current

   profession. When she was called upon to take on the role of Annie, Mary was excited to step back into

   the mindset that she loved so much as a child. Her enjoyment of the complexity of Annie’s character and

   the opportunity to put herself into the shoes of a woman that has to make tough decisions was both

   difficult and exhilarating. Mary hopes that she was able to portray Annie’s love for Jack in a way that is

   relatable and engaging so that the audience can see it come to life.</p>
