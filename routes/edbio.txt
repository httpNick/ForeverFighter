<p>The one thing that has impressed me in my sixty years of existence is the amazing power of human beings to persevere in the face of adversity. Not just in this film, but all over the world and all throughout history. My own family has struggled with this issue and it has taught me that love conquers all,  even at the end of life. I enjoy working with the performing artists in our area, because they have been willing to tackle difficult life issues and provide hope to their audiences. Their courage, and the love of others, make projects like this an inspiration. </p>
