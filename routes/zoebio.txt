<p>My name is Zoe Thompson and I am 11 years old. My first experience with acting was in the second grade, I was little Miss Muffet in the going buggy play at my school. From there I went on to appear in other school plays as well as parts in my church's plays. I am super excited to be cast in this wonderful story that needs to be told. I myself have experienced the effects and loss that cancer can do to a family. I hope this is just the first step in my acting future! I can't wait to learn from the wonderful actors and people who will be working on this film.</p>
